        <h2 id="my_name"> My name is Gregory bowles
        </h2>
        <h2 id="who_i_interviewed"> I Interviewed Loveleen Kaur</h2>
        <h3>The questions i asked where</h3>
              <li> What has been the toughest week at BCCA?
              </li>
              <li> What has been the easiest week at BCCA?
              </li>
              <li> What is your biggest victory so far at BCCA?
              </li>
            <ul id="answers">
              <li><strong> Loveleen's response to my first question was:</strong> The  toughest week at BCCA for me had to be the week where I missed a few days.  It was just harder to deal
              with some stuff going on in my personal life and stay focused on what was happening at school. Having my macbook mess up and die also made it tougher for me to complete assignments and do my benchmark.        
              </li>
              <li><strong> Her answer to my second question was:</strong> The easiest week at BCCA was probably the first week.
              We didn't really start off on pure, hard code and were justgetting used to how it all worked around here.
              </li>
              <li><strong> Her answer to my final question was:</strong> My biggest victory so far at BCCA would probably be getting through my first Unit project. 
              There were some hurdles that came along the way, however I was able to end the week on a better note with my project running well.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p id="Where"><strong>I interviewed Loveleen at 8:40 am, on Thursday the 19th of November, in 2020. It happened in Classroom 2 of Base Camp Coding Academy.</strong></p>
            <p id="summary"><strong>Loveleen's summary of Base Camp Coding Academy is:</strong> Base Camp is an amazing option and I am glad I chose it over college. 
              I was very hesitant to attend a coding academy or bootcamp at first just because it seems out of the norm. 
              But, if anyone is thinking about going out of the norm and taking this opportunity, I encourage it 100%. 
              It's a good way of knowing if you will be fit for the field and gives you many opportunities. I have made a family here and I know I got lucky.</p>
  
  
            <p><strong>Base Camp Coding Academy:</strong> is a program that takes highschool graduates and teaches them to be full stack developers.</p>
